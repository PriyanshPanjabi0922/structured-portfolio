# Structured Portfolio

This project is an improved version of my personal portfolio, focusing on better structure, layout, and visual clarity using HTML and CSS.

## About the project
I built this portfolio after studying how structured layouts and visual hierarchy are used in real-world websites. I used design references and tutorials to understand layout decisions and then implemented the 
structure while learning how different CSS rules affect alignment, spacing, and responsiveness.

## What I learned

- Using CSS for alignment and layout control
- Understanding and fixing layout issues through debugging

## Technologies used

- CSS

## Project status
Learning project focused on improving layout and structure. More enhancements may be added in the future.
